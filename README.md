# 🔑 OIDC Auth Simulator - Golang

Overview
A lightweight simulator built with Go to demonstrate the OIDC authentication flow using Keycloak as an identity broker and external IdPs like Google or Azure AD.

## ⚙️ Prerequisites <br>
- [ ] Go 1.21+ installed 
- [ ] Docker installed (for Keycloak) 
- [ ] Docker Compose installed 
- [ ] Browser to test login 

## 🚀 Setup & Run <br>
  ### 1. Start Keycloak (Docker)
- [ ] Spin up Keycloak using Docker Compose: 
     ```bash
     docker compose up -d
     ```
- [ ] Runs Keycloak on http://localhost:8080
- [ ] Default credentials for Keycloak
   - [ ] Username: admin
   - [ ] Password: admin
      
  ### 2. Configure Azure AD 
	- [ ] In your Azure home dashboard search for app registrations
	- [ ] Create a new app registration
	- [ ] With any suitable name and choose supported as accounts in this organisational directory only
	- [ ] Scroll down, under Redirect URI choose web and the link has to be pasted from the keycloak. 
	- [ ] Now copy the authorization and token endpoints (Oauth 2.0 authorization token endpoint and token endpoint) under endpoints.
	- [ ] Copy the client ID and paste it somewhere in notepad that will be used for keycloak configuration.
	- [ ] Create a new client secret and copy the client secret and paste it in notepad for configuring the keycloak. 
     
  ### 3. Configure Keycloak
     - [ ] Login to Keycloak admin console: http://localhost:8080 → Administration Console
	 - [ ] Create Realm :
	        • Click Create Realm
	        • Name: demo (must match OIDC_ISSUER in code)
	 - [ ] Add an Identity Provider :
	    - [ ] Choose OpenId Connect v1.0 
	    - [ ] Enter an alias
	    - [ ] Copy the redirect URI and use it in 4th step of (2. Configure Azure AD)
	    - [ ] Choose login flow as First broker login
	    - [ ] Sync mode as import
	    - [ ] Use the authorization and token endpoints from the 5th step of(2. Configure Azure AD)
	    - [ ] Paste the client ID and the client secret from the Azure AD.
	    - [ ] Mention default scopes as -> openid profile email  
	 - [ ] Create Client :
	    - [ ] Go to: Clients → Create client
		- [ ] Client ID: go-web-app
		- [ ] Client type: OpenID Connect
		- [ ] Root URL: (eg http://localhost:3000)
	    - [ ] Save
	 - [ ] Under Client settings:
	    - [ ] Enable Standard Flow ✅
		- [ ] Set Valid Redirect URIs to:eg http://localhost:3000/callback
	    - [ ] Save
     
      	✅ Now Keycloak is ready

###   4. Run Go Web App
- [ ] Start the Go web app:
 ```bash
 go run main.go
 ```
- [ ] App runs on (eg http://localhost:3000)

## 🔐 Login Flow
- [ ]	Visit http://localhost:3000 → you’ll see a Login with Keycloak button.
- [ ]	Click → you’ll be redirected to Keycloak login.
- [ ]	Enter the Keycloak user credentials (e.g., demo-user).
- [ ]	Keycloak redirects back to /callback on your Go app.
- [ ]	The app:
	- [ ]	Exchanges the authorization code for tokens (Access, ID, Refresh).
	- [ ]	Verifies the ID token signature.
	- [ ]	Displays:
	- [ ]	Access token (truncated)
	   - [ ]	Full ID token
	   - [ ]	Decoded claims (JSON map)

## 🛠️ Configuration
	   The Go app reads config from environment variables (with defaults):

## 📖 How It Works (Quick Primer)
- [ ]	User clicks login → app generates:
	    	•	state (CSRF protection)
	    	•	code_challenge (PKCE)
- [ ]	Redirects user to Keycloak authorization endpoint.
- [ ]	After login, Keycloak redirects back with an authorization code.
- [ ]	The Go app:
    - [ ]	Exchanges code + code_verifier for tokens.
	- [ ]	Verifies ID token signature (issuer, audience).
	- [ ]	Extracts and shows user claims.

  		This is the OIDC Authorization Code Flow with PKCE.

## 🧹 Cleanup
  	To stop Keycloak: docker compose down

✅ With these steps, one should be able to pull the repo, run Keycloak + Go app, and test OIDC login end-to-end.
